Papers can be [submitted to the journal at any time](/submission/), but submitted papers are batched and reviewed in cycles with strict deadlines. The batch processing is designed to keep everyone involved (editors, reviewers and authors) on track, and to establish a strong sense of predictability for when specific activities are to happen. The goal is to have a fast turnaround of about **four months** from start to end of each reviewing cycle.

In normal operation, the journal uses the following cycles for each Volume (deadlines are AoE):
